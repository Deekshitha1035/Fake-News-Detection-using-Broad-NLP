## ðŸ”¹ Overview
A **Fake News Detection system** built using **BERT** and NLP techniques to classify news as **fake** or **real**.  
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction scripts.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Train a BERT-based classifier
- Preprocess and merge multiple datasets
- Predict fake/real news from new text
- Lightweight repo (datasets and models stored externally)
